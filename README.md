# Personal Address Label Generator

This is a personal script designed to generate PDFs of address labels formatted for Avery 5160 sticky label sheets.

It is tailored to work with my specific address data, which can be in either CSV or Microsoft Excel format. The script reads the address information, allows for filtering of specific addresses, and then creates a printable PDF file.
